# C Programming Concepts

This repository contains a collection of C programs that illustrate various concepts in C programming. The programs are organized by topic and are accompanied by brief comments explaining the key concepts and techniques used. 

## Getting Started

To compile and run these programs, you will need a C compiler such as GCC or Clang. You can install these compilers on your system using a package manager or by downloading them from their respective websites. Once you have a compiler installed, you can navigate to the directory containing the program you wish to run and use the `gcc` or `clang` command to compile it, like so:

```sh
$ gcc program.c -o program
$ ./program
```

## Concepts Covered

The following table summarizes the concepts covered in this repository:

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Basic Syntax | Basic structure of a C program, variables, input/output |
| Control Structures | Loops, conditional statements |
| Functions | Functions, recursion |
| Pointers | Pointers, memory manipulation |
| Arrays | Arrays, multi-dimensional arrays |
| Strings | String literals, string manipulation functions, character arrays |
| Structs | Custom data types, fields of different types |

For each topic, there are one or more programs that demonstrate the key concepts. The programs and their descriptions are listed below:
